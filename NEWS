Noteworthy changes in dudders-1.02

 - The crypto plugins should no longer export unresolved symbols.

 - The authority can now be overidden with the -m and -z options.
   This circumvents the search for the master and zone using the local
   resolver.

 - The manual page is now in section 8, and has been renamed
   accordingly.

 - Private key parsing is stricter, which prevents some potential
   segfaults (for example when trying to use a dnssec-keygen .key file
   instead of the .private file).

Noteworthy changes in dudders-1.01

 - dudders now supports multiple crypto packages at the same time,
   using dlopen, on supported POSIX platforms.  This is enabled by
   default.

 - parsing of DNS responses is a little stricter, which prevents some
   potential segfaults.
