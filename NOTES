Using libresolv
===============

The resolver library would be convenient to use if it worked.
However, it's not particularly reliable.  uClibc is missing functions,
and some options are not implemented under any of the standard
libraries surveyed.

Furthermore, it is customary for the standard functions to be macros
and/or prototype-only.  Therefore it's not possible to check for just
their symbols or just their declarations.  Furthermore on at least one
system (OS X 10.4) the manual page states they can be linked with just
libc, when libresolv is needed too.

[1] 7th parameter newrr for updates not implemented

[2] RES_PRIMARY option not supported in BSD.

[3] The handling of authority-only responses varies.  On OS X, h_errno
is NO_DATA.  In uClibc, h_errno is TRY_AGAIN.  However, both write the
response packet into the buffer under these circumstances (although
there's no documented guarantee of such behaviour).
