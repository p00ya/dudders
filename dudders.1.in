.SH NAME
dudders \- update DNS record
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dudders [-k \fPRIVKEY\fR] [-n \fIKEYNAME\fR]
\fIDOMAIN\fR \fITTL\fR \fIADDRESS\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
Perform a DNS update request to set \fIDOMAIN\fR's A record to
\fIADDRESS\fR, with \fITTL\fR seconds to live, overwriting any
previous A records for the domain in the Internet class.  The
transaction is authenticated using the RSA private key in the file
\fIPRIVKEY\fR to provide a SIG(0), or standard input if \fIPRIVKEY\fR
is not specified.  The master server (as defined in the MNAME field of
the zone's SOA record) is used.

If the filename \fPRIVKEY\fR is provided and it is in the
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR(8) format, the keyname can be inferred from the
filename.  Otherwise, it must be provided via the \fPKEYNAME\fR
switch.

The private key must be in the format generated by
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR(8) using the "-a RSAMD5" option.  The private key
format reported by the reference version of \fBdnssec\-keygen\fR(8)
was v1.2; it uses colon separated key value pairs, base64 encoding
unsigned multiprecision integer key components.

A DNS Server Failure error may indicate that \fIPRIVKEY\fR is not
authorised for signing transactions for \fIDOMAIN\fR.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Zero is returned iff the server reports that the update was
successful.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.TP \fB\-\-help\fR
Output a brief help message and exit.
.TP \fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Wildcards are not supported for \fIDOMAIN\fR.

Only RSA/MD5 keys/signatures are supported.

Only IPv4 addresses within the Internet class are supported.
