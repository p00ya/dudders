Dudders is a utility for updating DNS records.

Dudders spells "DHCP Updating DNS Duly Embracing RSA SIG(0)" (with
some poetic license).  It points a domain name to a given IP address,
using the RFC2136 DNS UPDATE protocol and a SIG(0) signature.  It is
designed with embedded systems in mind.  This has several implications
for users:

 - you can't use it to do all the things DNS UPDATE can do,
 - it will error and exit rather than dealing with problems;
 - it will fit and work on your embedded device!

For a general purpose DNS UPDATE utility, use ISC's nsupdate, which is
distributed with BIND.  Other free clients with similar functionality
include ddclient, ez-ipupdate, updatedd, ipupdate, and dnssec-tools's
ifup-dyndns.

The ISC BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual contains instructions
for configuring your zone's DNS server to support a SIG(0) update,
under the DNSSEC section.

For instructions on how to invoke the program, consult the dudders(1)
manual page which is built by configure.

License
-------

Dudders is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, the text of
which is included in the file COPYING.

Installation
------------

A POSIX-like standard C library is expected, complete with resolver.
The BSD, uClibc, and glibc libraries should all work.

An external libarary is required by dudders for cryptography.
The following crypto libraries are supported:
 - openssl: The OpenSSL project's libcrypto
 - gcrypt: The GnuPG spinoff crypto library libgcrypt

By default the `configure' shell script will try and guess which to
use.  You can override this by calling configure with:

  --with-crypto=CRYPTO

Where CRYPTO is "openssl" or "gcrypt".

By default, the program is built with a considerable amount of
debugging information.  To make it leaner, call configure with:

  CFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -O2"

Consult the INSTALL file for additional instructions on building and
installing dudders.
